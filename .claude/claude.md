# SystemMatchAi

## Project Overview


What are you building? An AI agent system to help schedule spa treatments and massages for small businesses.


### Target Customer
A spa with three or four workers, maybe up to twenty appointments a day.


### Value Proposition
Customers choose your value and cost savings. Cool.


## Key Documentation

This project was created with Confabulator, an AI-powered project documentation wizard. All major requirements and specifications are documented in the `confabulator/` directory:

### Essential Reading
1. **Product Requirements Document** (`confabulator/PRD.md`)
   - Complete feature specifications
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - Technical requirements
   - Success metrics

2. **Project Vision** (`confabulator/project-vision.md`)
   - Problem statement and motivation
   - Target users and use cases
   - Long-term vision and goals

3. **Implementation Plan** (`confabulator/implementation-plan.md`)
   - Technical architecture
   - Development phases and milestones
   - Task breakdown and priorities
   - Technology stack decisions

4. **Business Model Canvas** (`confabulator/business-model-canvas.md`)
   - Revenue streams
   - Cost structure
   - Key partnerships
   - Customer relationships

## Tech Stack

TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Express, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, React Hook Form, Zod, Aws, DrizzleORM, Stripe, NextAuth.js, Vercel, Mongodb

## Development Guidelines

When working on this project:

1. **Start with Context**: Always review the relevant sections of the PRD before implementing features
2. **Follow the Plan**: The implementation plan outlines the recommended development sequence
3. **Reference User Stories**: Each feature should map to user stories in the PRD
4. **Maintain Alignment**: Technical decisions should align with the architecture in the implementation plan

## Current Focus

The MVP focuses on these core capabilities:

- The MVP should include scheduling, information about the services, and warm communication with the customer. Also, from the admin side, the spa needs to choose available hours when they are open and staffed, so there is staff scheduling for administration work.

See `confabulator/implementation-plan.md` for the complete development roadmap.

## Important Notes

- This is a both application
- All generated documentation is in the `confabulator/` directory
- The PRD contains the definitive feature requirements
- The implementation plan provides the technical roadmap
